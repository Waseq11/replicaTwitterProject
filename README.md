Hello, This is a Twitter clone web application developed by me and my colleagues at LaSalle College. It was created with C# ASP.NET on Visual Studio 2022.

Functionalities :
*Creates a database automatically with Entity Framework Core.
*Creates 5 users on first run.

The launching page is the Login Page, where You can either log in with valid credentials
or Sign Up by clicking the sign up button.

Implemented validation to both the log in as well as sign up forms:
*A user cannot create another account with the same email.
*A user can only log in with correct credentials.

After a successful login, user is redirected to Tweets Index where the user can see
all his tweets and the tweets of other users he follow.

*User can post tweets.
*User can follow, unfollow other users from a list of all the users on Users Index page.
*User can like, unlike tweets.
*User can edit, his profile.
